Organised by

Point of the workshop
The idea is this: very few participants and basically no talks - to give people time to discuss problems freely. This, in fact, would be the point of the workshop: to create a space in which to pick some interesting problems, to then begin working on them in groups.
A few words on the &ldquo;selection principle&rdquo; behind the list of participants: as you might have noticed, the people I thought of when writing this email are all academically young, between PhD and postdocs. This is because I&rsquo;m quite convinced that the power dynamics that tend to ensue between younger and older academics might very well cripple an otherwise freer exchange of ideas. Of course, we all work on related subject." />
