## Point of the workshop
The idea is this: very few participants and basically no talks - to give people time to discuss problems freely. This, in fact, would be the point of the workshop: to create a space in which to pick some interesting problems, to then begin working on them in groups. 
A few words on the "selection principle" behind the list of participants: as you might have noticed, the people I thought of when writing this email are all academically young, between PhD and postdocs. This is because I'm quite convinced that the power dynamics that tend to ensue between younger and older academics might very well cripple an otherwise freer exchange of ideas. Of course, we all work on related subject.

## Logistics

### Accommodation
It is provided from Sunday 22nd to Saturday 28th. 

### Travel
 
* Arrivals

There are two ways to get here. 

> The first one is taking the Renfe R3 train line to Ripoll, and then a Teisa bus from Ripoll to Sant Pau de Seguries. The train station is in Placa de Catalunya. The bus and train station in Ripoll are super close to each other. The train passes every hour or so, and so does the bus in Ripoll. If you are not rushing, this is an ok option. The issue is that the train is often delayed. 

$~$

> I reccommend using the bus service when possible. The bus service never disappoints :). You can find the timetable [here](https://www.teisa-bus.com/). You'll find the bus stop at *Avenida Gran Via, 658*. Note: you have to get on the bus to *Camprodon*. Right before, there's a bus to *Olot* - this is the wrong one!
